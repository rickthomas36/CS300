What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The projects for this course involved solving various problems related to data structures and algorithms. Project One focused on analyzing the run-time and memory usage of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Project Two involved sorting and printing a list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
In approaching these problems, I first understood the problem statement and requirements, and then determined the most appropriate data structure to use based on the specific characteristics of the problem. Understanding data structures is important in solving problems because it allows for efficient and effective manipulation of data. I used various techniques such as implementing algorithms and optimizing code for performance and memory usage.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
One roadblock I encountered while going through the activities was understanding the nuances of various data structures and their implementation details. I overcame this by reviewing class notes, researching online resources, and seeking help from peers and instructors. In Project Two, one roadblock was implementing the sorting algorithm correctly. I overcame this by breaking down the problem into smaller parts, testing each part separately, and then integrating them into a working solution.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on these projects has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by reinforcing the importance of understanding data structures and algorithms. It has also taught me to consider the trade-offs between different data structures and to choose the most appropriate one based on the specific requirements of the problem. In addition, it has emphasized the importance of testing, optimization, and documentation in developing high-quality software.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work on these projects has evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by reinforcing the importance of modular design, clear and concise code, and commenting. It has also taught me to consider edge cases and error handling, and to refactor code for readability and maintainability. Overall, working on these projects has been a valuable learning experience that has improved my programming skills and approach.
